        <h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
        <p>
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. 
            It bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding by analyzing text and speech data. NLP combines computational linguistics with 
            statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to process and generate natural language.
        </p>

        <h2>What is NLP?</h2>
        <p>
            NLP focuses on teaching machines how to interact with humans through language. This involves tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, 
            speech recognition, and text generation. By leveraging massive datasets, NLP models can learn the intricacies of human language, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
