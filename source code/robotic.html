        <h1>Robotics: Transforming the Future</h1>
        <p>
            Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that designs, builds, and operates robots. These intelligent machines can perform a wide range of tasks, from industrial automation to healthcare support. Robotics combines principles from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
        <p>
            Robotics is the science and technology behind the design, manufacturing, and application of robots. Robots are programmable machines capable of carrying out tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. They can mimic human actions or perform tasks more efficiently, accurately, and safely.
        </p>

        </p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>1. Mechanical Systems</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanical structure of a robot includes actuators, joints, and frames. These components determine how the robot moves and interacts with its environment. Examples include robotic arms, wheels, and humanoid structures.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2. Sensors</h3>
            <p>
                Sensors help robots perceive their environment by detecting changes in light, temperature, pressure, or distance. Common sensors include cameras, LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and touch sensors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3. Control Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Control systems manage the robot's actions and responses. This involves software that processes sensor input, plans tasks, and sends commands to actuators.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4. Power Supply</h3>
            <p>
                Robots require power to operate. Power sources can range from batteries to solar panels, depending on the robot's application and environment.
            </p>
        </div>
