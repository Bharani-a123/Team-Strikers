        <h1>Quantum Computing</h1>
        <p>
            Quantum computing represents one of the most transformative advancements in modern technology. 
            By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers have the potential 
            to solve problems that are practically impossible for classical computers. This emerging field is opening doors to new possibilities 
            in cryptography, artificial intelligence, drug discovery, and much more.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
        <p>
            Quantum computing operates on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once. 
            Unlike classical bits that represent either 0 or 1, qubits leverage the phenomenon of superposition, 
            allowing them to perform many calculations simultaneously. Quantum entanglement, another key feature, 
            links qubits in ways that their states become dependent on each other, even when separated by large distances.

        </div>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Superposition:</b> Qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling exponential computational power.</li>
            <li><b>Entanglement:</b> Entangled qubits can share information instantaneously, irrespective of distance.</li>
            <li><b>Interference:</b> Quantum algorithms use constructive and destructive interference to arrive at solutions more efficiently.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. Below are some of its most promising applications:
        </p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>1. Cryptography</h3>
            <p>
                Quantum computers can break traditional encryption algorithms, but they also pave the way for quantum encryption, 
                which is theoretically unbreakable. This duality presents challenges and opportunities for securing digital communication.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Quantum computing can accelerate the training of machine learning models by solving complex optimization problems more efficiently.
                It is particularly useful in processing vast datasets for pattern recognition and predictive analytics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3. Drug Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                Simulating molecular interactions is a computationally expensive task for classical computers. Quantum computers can 
                model these interactions at a quantum level, accelerating drug discovery and the development of new materials.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4. Optimization Problems</h3>
            <p>
                Industries such as logistics, finance, and manufacturing can benefit from quantum computing's ability to solve complex optimization problems. 
                For instance, quantum computers can optimize supply chain logistics or financial portfolio strategies in seconds.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Challenges in Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Despite its immense potential, quantum computing faces several challenges. Building stable qubits, minimizing quantum noise, and developing 
            scalable systems are some of the key hurdles. Additionally, designing quantum algorithms that outperform classical counterparts remains an 
            active area of research.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
            As quantum technology matures, its impact will extend beyond computation to redefine how we approach problems in various fields. 
            Tech giants like IBM, Google, and startups like Rigetti are actively working to bring quantum computing into mainstream use.
