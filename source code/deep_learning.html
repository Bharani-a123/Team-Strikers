        <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
        <p>
            Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for decision-making. 
            It uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and analyze complex patterns in large datasets. Deep learning powers many modern AI applications, 
            from voice recognition to autonomous vehicles.
        </p>

        <h2>How Deep Learning Works</h2>
        <p>
            Deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, which consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). These layers are categorized into:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Input Layer:</b> Receives raw data, such as images, text, or audio.</li>
            <li><b>Hidden Layers:</b> Perform computations, extracting features and learning patterns from data.</li>
            <li><b>Output Layer:</b> Produces the final prediction or decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By increasing the number of hidden layers, deep learning models can learn more intricate representations of data, making them ideal for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.
