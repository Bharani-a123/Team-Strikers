        <h1>Full Stack Development: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
        <p>
            Full stack development refers to the end-to-end development of a web application, covering both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) aspects. Full stack developers are proficient in a wide range of technologies, from designing the user interface to managing databases and server-side logic.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Full Stack Development?</h2>
        <p>
            Full stack development involves working with both the front-end (the part of the web application users interact with) and the back-end (the server-side processes that handle data and user requests). A full stack developer is skilled in handling both of these domains, creating a seamless experience from start to finish.
        </p>

        </p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>1. Frontend Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                The front-end is the user-facing part of the application, and developers use the following technologies to create interactive and responsive user interfaces:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>HTML:</b> The foundation of web development, used to structure the content on web pages.</li>

                <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Adds interactivity and dynamic features to the web pages.</li>
                <li><b>React, Angular, Vue:</b> Modern front-end frameworks and libraries used to build single-page applications and improve user experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2. Backend Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                The back-end is responsible for the server-side logic, database management, and API integration. These are some of the most widely used technologies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Node.js:</b> A JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript.</li>
                <li><b>Express.js:</b> A web application framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and handling requests.</li>
                <li><b>Python (Django, Flask):</b> Python frameworks for building robust server-side applications.</li>
                <li><b>Ruby on Rails:</b> A powerful framework for building dynamic web applications using Ruby.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3. Database Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                Databases are essential for storing and managing data in full stack applications. Some of the most popular databases include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>MongoDB:</b> A NoSQL database, commonly used with Node.js for scalable applications.</li>
                <li><b>MySQL:</b> A relational database management system (RDBMS) used for managing structured data.</li>
                <li><b>PostgreSQL:</b> An advanced open-source RDBMS, known for its performance and flexibility.</li>
                <li><b>SQLite:</b> A lightweight database for smaller applications or local development environments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4. Version Control and Deployment</h3>
            <p>
                Full stack developers use version control and deployment tools to manage code changes and deploy applications:
